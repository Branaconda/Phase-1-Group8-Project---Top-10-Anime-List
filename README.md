## Introduction
The Anime Rater is a web application that displays a top 10 list of anime, as well as detailed information pertaining to each. The application allows the user to rate each anime, and add comments to each item. This project demonstrates the usage of a JSON database and javascript integration into a web application to create a functional front-end product. 

## Installation 

Run the following command in your terminal to start the JSON server:

```json-server --watch db.json```

Access your server with the following URL: 

[http://localhost:3000/anime]

Then, open the 'index.html' file in your browser.

## Usage
- Clicking an Anime from the div will display a detailed description, user likes, and user comments.
- The user will be able to add their own comments 
- The user will be able to like or dislike an anime 

## Deliverables 
The user should be able to: 

1. See all anime images displayed within the div. When the page loads, data will be requested from the server through a GET request.
2. Click on each image to see a detailed description and comment form 
3. Leave a like on an anime
4. Add a comment to the comment section anime. The comment does not need to persist.
5. Trigger a mouseover event on the like/dislike buttons
